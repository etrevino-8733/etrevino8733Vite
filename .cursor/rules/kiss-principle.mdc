# KISS Principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

Simplicity should be a key goal in design. Unnecessary complexity should be avoided. Choose the **simplest solution that meets the requirements**.

## Guidelines

- **Prefer plain solutions**: Use straightforward logic, clear naming, and minimal abstractions until a real need arises.
- **Avoid over-engineering**: Don't add layers, patterns, or abstractions "for the future" unless the requirement exists now.
- **Meet requirements, no more**: Solve the stated problem; resist adding features or edge-case handling that wasn't asked for.
- **Reduce moving parts**: Fewer files, fewer dependencies, and fewer branches make code easier to understand and change.

## Examples

**Abstraction**
- Prefer a simple function or a small module over a full framework or plugin system when the problem is small.
- Introduce abstractions (interfaces, base classes, layers) only when you have at least two concrete cases or a clear, current need.

**Control flow**
- Prefer early returns and linear flow over deep nesting and multiple flags.
- Use the smallest set of language features that clearly express the intent (e.g., a loop instead of recursion when a loop is clearer).

**APIs and data**
- Expose the minimum surface area needed by callers; avoid "just in case" parameters or options.
- Prefer explicit, readable data structures over clever compression or indirection.

When in doubt, implement the simplest version that satisfies the requirements, then refine only if real needs emerge.
