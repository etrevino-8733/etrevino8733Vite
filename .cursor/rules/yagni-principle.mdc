# YAGNI Principle (You Ain't Gonna Need It)

Don't implement functionality until it's actually needed. Focus on **current requirements**; add features only when there's a **clear, immediate need**.

## Guidelines

- **Implement for now, not later**: Build what the current task or requirement asks for. Skip "we might need this someday" code.
- **No speculative features**: Don't add parameters, options, or code paths "just in case" a future use appears.
- **Clear need before code**: If there's no concrete requirement or user story for a feature, don't build it yet.
- **Defer generalization**: Write for the one case you have. Generalize only when a second real case appears.

## Examples

**APIs and parameters**
- ❌ Adding an optional `format` parameter "for future export formats."
- ✅ A single behavior that matches the requirement; add options when a second format is actually requested.

**Abstractions**
- ❌ Introducing a plugin system or interface "so we can swap implementations later."
- ✅ One implementation that works; refactor to an abstraction when you have a second implementation to support.

**Data and validation**
- ❌ Validating or storing fields "we might use later."
- ✅ Model and validate only what the current flow uses.

**Tests and docs**
- ❌ Writing tests or docs for hypothetical future behavior.
- ✅ Test and document the behavior that exists and is required now.

When in doubt, ask: "Is there a concrete, current requirement for this?" If not, leave it out until there is.
